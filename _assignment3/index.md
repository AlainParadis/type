This publication will have no photos or graphics to create variety on the page. We'll have to do that with the type only. The second major consideration is that this is meant to be a highly-functional design in that it's a user manual. We'll really need to consider how it's used in the real world.

This will include the following considerations:

[Designing our Grid](subpage1.html)
: We'll design a single-column grid using the Van de Graaf Canon.

[Type Selection](subpage2.html)
: As is the custom in such publications, we'll work with only one serif typeface. It'll be crucial that it contains a broad variety of glyphs.

[Styling Our Type](subpage3.html)
: This is a lot of the heavy lifting, where attention to detail is vital. We'll style each element our content demands.

[Putting It All Together](subpage4.html)
: This is the mechanical work to be done after all the design work is complete. There's little creativity here. This is about assembling all the design elements in an InDesign document.
