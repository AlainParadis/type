  ## Assignment Ideas

  ### Hierarchy

  Create hierarchy with the given text as shown on [this page](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/9781315301532/xhtml/13_Chapter07.xhtml#ch7). The text will be short. It should be an event announcement. There will be different versions for students to work on. It will include:

  - Title
  - Sub-title
  - Date
  - Place
  - Descriptive text

  I'll provide printed sheets of paper with a grid printed on them. These will be used to sketch layouts before building them. Sharpies, Fineliners and pencils will be best for this. Well use:

  - Size
  - Weight
  - Width
  - Alignment
  - Tracking
  - Greys
  - Orientation
  - Italics
  
  Beyond the sketches, you'll choose only one font family with varied weights and widths. Limit yourself to only greyscale. No graphics are allowed.

  Submit a single PDF file.

  ### Designing Grids

  We're always told to create a grid to guide our page layouts. But where do we start? How do we decide how to divide the page? We'll use [various formula](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/9781315301532/xhtml/14_Chapter08.xhtml#ch8) to create harmonious grids.

  ### Web Typography

  Create a layout using [this information](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/web-typography-cheat-sheet/). We'll create a page layout with multiple columns. Choose a pair of fonts that work well together and create sufficient contrast. We'll control hyphenation, and other variables listed on the page linked above.

  Submit the HTML page and the CSS file or a link to GitHub.

  ### Magazine Layout

  Create a [six-page magazine feature article](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-type-project/9780136816034/ch34.xhtml#ch34) combining text, pictures, call outs, and captions, and making effective use of white space

  We'll design layouts with [varied page elements](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/9781315301532/xhtml/15_Chapter09.xhtml#ch9), such as:

  - Headings
  - Subheads
  - Body copy
  - Table data
  - Pull quotes
  - Folios
  - Running headlines
  - Block quotes
