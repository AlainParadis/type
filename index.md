  ## Assignment Ideas

  ### Hierarchy

  Create hierarchy with the given text as shown on [this page](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/9781315301532/xhtml/13_Chapter07.xhtml#ch7). The text will be short. It should be an event announcement. There will be different versions for students to work on. It will include:

  - Title
  - Sub-title
  - Date
  - Place
  - Descriptive text

  I'll provide printed sheets of paper with a grid printed on them. These will be used to sketch layouts before building them. Sharpies, Fineliners and pencils will be best for this. Well use:

  - Size
  - Weight
  - Width
  - Alignment
  - Tracking
  - Greys
  - Orientation
  - Italics
  
  Beyond the sketches, you'll choose only one font family with varied weights and widths. Limit yourself to only greyscale. No graphics are allowed.

  Submit a single PDF file.

  ## Designing Grids

  We're always told to create a grid to guide our page layouts. But where do we start? How do we decide how to divide the page? We'll use [various formula](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/9781315301532/xhtml/14_Chapter08.xhtml#ch8) to create harmonious grids.
