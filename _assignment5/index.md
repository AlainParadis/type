All the content and design decisions we made for the user manual now need to be posted to the web with responsive pages. You get it. No re-inventing the wheel here. Just re-tooling.

This is not a coding assignment per se, but your content and code need to be sound, based on what you've learned to date.

Design Transposition
: The print and web versions need to be design siblings. That means that they should be readily identifiable as the same publication. We'll do this by using the same type families. The same type treatments will be transposed in CSS. Colours will be re-used.

    - Create your type hierarchy in CSS.
    - Document colours for use in CSS.
    - Create your page layout in CSS.

Design File Structure
: How will the printed publication be built as web pages? You need to determine the structure of your files, file-naming conventions, etc... A navigation system will need to be built.

Build Out the Site
: Implement your design decisions in HTML & CSS.
