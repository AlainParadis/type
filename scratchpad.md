  ### Grids
  #### Regular Assignment

  This should come first, since they're the underlying structure of all layouts.

  Students will design three different types of grids. They'll place provided content on the grids using two fonts I've dictated to them. All their creative decisions should go towards placing elements on the grid -- nothing else.

  ### Font Pairing
  #### Small Assignment

  

  ### Hierarchy
  #### Assignment

  This is the next logical step, after grids.
