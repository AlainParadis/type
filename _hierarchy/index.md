### Typographic Hierarchy

The purpose of typographic hierarchy is to create a harmonious layout which helps the reader to absorb the content in a logical order.

Visual hierarchy, along with the page layout grid and the content itself together form the composition which communicates the message. Hierarchy establishes the order in which the content is absorbed. It determines the path the reader's attention follows through the content.

The elements available to the designer to create visual hierarchy include size, weight, width, case, colour (greys, in this case), alignment, orientation, tracking,  italics. 

The goal is to create clear differentiation between items and harmony on the page. 

### Typeface Selection

Our choice of typefaces needs to be appropriate to the audience and the message. When making a choice, the families need to include any technical features required by the project. These could be certain punctuation mark, old style numerals, small caps, etc...

In this case, we'll only use one family, so we need to ensure that it's a big one with a broad variety of weights and widths.

### The Grid

We'll use an informal grid for this project. That means that we'll start with the most important element, then align the second element to it, then the third, and so on.

## The Design Brief

You will use the provided content to create a harmonious, type-only layout with clear, deliberate and thoughtful hierarchy.

### Specifications

Typeface Selection
: You'll use only one family. Choose wisely. It should be appropriate to the message and the audience.

Dimensions
: You'll create your layout on a 10" x 10" page.

Tools
: Use InDesign exclusively.

Colour
: Greyscale. This means it can all be in solid black. Optionally, you can used tints, creating greys.

Graphics
: No graphics are permitted. You can reverse type out of black, but go easy with this.

### The Process

You will provide at least 5 progressive versions of your piece. Start with one element of hierarchy, like size. On the second version, you'll apply the first, then add another element, like weight. Keep adding only one element of hierarchy with each version. Stop once you've achieved a good balance of differentiation and harmony. 

Before working on the actual hierarchy of the type, we need to inventory our content. If our text has three levels of titles and various types of lists, this will affect how we design our type system. That's why it's important to read everything and inventory what we're working with.

You will be given printed sheets of paper with a grid printed on them. These will be used to sketch layouts before building them. Sharpies, Fineliners and pencils will be best for this.

Beyond the sketches, you'll choose only one font family with varied weights and widths. Limit yourself to only greyscale. No graphics are allowed.
