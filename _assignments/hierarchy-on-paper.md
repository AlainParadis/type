title: "Hierarchy on Paper"
content: |
  We'll use provided content to design type hierarchy with two font families. The goal is to create clear differentiation between items and harmony on the page. 


  Create a natural flow to your layouts with proper hierarchy. We can use size, weight, width, case, colour, italics. 


  Before working on the actual hierarchy of the type, we need to inventory our content. If our text has three levels of titles and various types of lists, this will affect how we design our type system. That's why it's important to read everything and inventory what we're working with.
