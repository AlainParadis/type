  ## The Theory

  We're always told to create a grid to guide our page layouts. But where do we start? How do we decide how to divide the page? We'll use [various formula](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/9781315301532/xhtml/14_Chapter08.xhtml#ch8) to create harmonious grids.

  Page layout grids can be thought of as imaginary lines that divide the page. They create a visual path from one element to the next, creating relationships and continuity between adjacent elements on the page.

  There are many types of grids:

  Ad Hoc or Informal
  : This grid appears as you work. Align elements on the page relative to each other.

  Single column
  : This is used for publications like books where each page has only one block of text, usually justified.

  Multi-column
  : This grid has more variation. It allows for more complex layouts with text & images.

  Modular
  : Even more flexible, the modular grid allows for varied types of content. You can have images, tables and more.

  Hierarchical
  : In this type of grid, the horizontal units create hierarchy.

  It sounds like using a grid would make a page design very static. Not so! There is a list of the types of grids below. The single-column grid can indeed be static. That's its purpose. One application of the single-column grid is a novel. They're used to create consistency between the pages to increase reading speed. Imaging if a novel were laid out like a magazine. It would take forever to find your place each time the reader turns the page.

  Modular grids allow for an great amount of versatility for your page layouts. The designer can achieve movement and rhythm when they really make the most of such a grid.

  Create layout grids. We'll consider: 

  - Balance 
  - Symmetry 
  - Focal point 
  - White space 
  - Informal & formal grids 

  We'll learn the anatomy of page grids including, margins, columns, gutters, etcâ€¦ 

  ## The Design Brief

  Design an informal, a single-column and a modular grid using the formula we've learned. Once you're done, add content in the form of grey boxes where the elements would be. The darker the grey, the more emphasis it has. The lighter, the less important it is.
