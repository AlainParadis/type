## The Theory

This assignment is about applying the skills learned during the semester for the page and for the screen. 

This assignment will include all the skills learned this semester. It will include: 

- Font Pairing
- Hierarchy
- Layout Grids
- Copy Fitting
- and moreâ€¦

Create a [six-page magazine feature article](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-type-project/9780136816034/ch34.xhtml#ch34) combining text, pictures, call outs, and captions, and making effective use of white space

We'll design layouts with [varied page elements](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/9781315301532/xhtml/15_Chapter09.xhtml#ch9), such as:

- Headings
- Subheads
- Body copy
- Table data
- Pull quotes
- Folios
- Running headlines
- Block quotes
