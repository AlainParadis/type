  ## The Theory

  Create a [six-page magazine feature article](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-type-project/9780136816034/ch34.xhtml#ch34) combining text, pictures, call outs, and captions, and making effective use of white space

  We'll design layouts with [varied page elements](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/9781315301532/xhtml/15_Chapter09.xhtml#ch9), such as:

  - Headings
  - Subheads
  - Body copy
  - Table data
  - Pull quotes
  - Folios
  - Running headlines
  - Block quotes
