  ## Fluid Type Scales

  Rather than using arbitrary numerical type break points, fluid type generators work with steps.

  This is a really good explanation of the [evolution of the grid](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/building-better-ui-designs-layout-grids/) from the page to screens.

  - [Utopia Fluid Type Generator](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/)
  - [Google's layout guidelines](https://material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html#principles)

  Google developers use [*density-independant pixels*](https://material.io/design/layout/pixel-density.html#density-independence) as a unit of measure. It's abbreviated as *dp* and pronounced *dips*.
