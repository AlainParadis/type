title: "Hierarchy"
details: |

  We'll use provided content to design type hierarchy with two font families. The goal is to create clear differentiation between items and harmony on the page. 

  Create a natural flow to your layouts with proper hierarchy. We can use size, weight, width, case, colour, italics. 

  Before working on the actual hierarchy of the type, we need to inventory our content. If our text has three levels of titles and various types of lists, this will affect how we design our type system. That's why it's important to read everything and inventory what we're working with.

  Create hierarchy with the given text as shown on [this page](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/9781315301532/xhtml/13_Chapter07.xhtml#ch7). The text will be short. It should be an event announcement. There will be different versions for students to work on. It will include:

  - Title
  - Sub-title
  - Date
  - Place
  - Descriptive text

  I'll provide printed sheets of paper with a grid printed on them. These will be used to sketch layouts before building them. Sharpies, Fineliners and pencils will be best for this. We'll use:

  - Size
  - Weight
  - Width
  - Alignment
  - Tracking
  - Greys
  - Orientation
  - Italics
  
  Beyond the sketches, you'll choose only one font family with varied weights and widths. Limit yourself to only greyscale. No graphics are allowed.
