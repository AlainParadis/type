### Web Typography

Create a layout using [this information](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/web-typography-cheat-sheet/). We'll create a page layout with multiple columns. Choose a pair of fonts that work well together and create sufficient contrast. We'll control hyphenation, and other variables listed on the page linked above.

Submit the HTML page and the CSS file or a link to GitHub.
