## The Theory

There are many types of grids. These are a few important types:

[Ad Hoc or Informal]({{site.url}}/grids-pages/adhoc-grids.html)
: This grid appears as you work. Align elements on the page relative to each other.

[Single column]({{site.url}}/grids-pages/single-column-grids.html)
: This is used for publications like books where each page has only one block of text, usually justified.

[Multi-column]({{site.url}}/grids-pages/multi-column-grids.html)
: This grid has more variation. It allows for more complex layouts with text & images.

[Modular]({{site.url}}/grids-pages/modular-grids.html)
: Even more flexible, the modular grid allows for varied types of content. You can have images, tables and more. Modular grids allow for an great amount of versatility for your page layouts. The designer can achieve movement and rhythm when they really make the most of such a grid.

[Hierarchical]({{site.url}}/grids-pages/hierarchical-grids.html)
: In this type of grid, the horizontal units create hierarchy.

It sounds like using a grid would make a page design very static. Not so! There is a list of the types of grids below. The single-column grid can indeed be static. That's its purpose. One application of the single-column grid is a novel. They're used to create consistency between the pages to increase reading speed. Imaging if a novel were laid out like a magazine. It would take forever to find your place each time the reader turns the page.



### The Anatomy of the Grid

Grids are made of columns, gutters, modules, margins, flow lines and the marker.
