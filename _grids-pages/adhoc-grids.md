Ad hoc (or informal) grids are created as you sketch your pages. They don't have the rhythmic structure the other types of grids have. There aren't columns. Elements simply align with each other on the page.

## When Do I Use Them?

These are best used for single-page designs. We'd never use this type of grid for a whole publication.
