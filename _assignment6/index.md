Part of the assignment will be to layout the 12 months. The more important part will be to design the type artwork which accompanies them. There will also be a cover to the calendar.

Students must choose a font for each month. They'll decide what the criteria are for their choices. There needs to be a theme. As an example, one could use an astrological theme. Someone could look up the etymology of the month names. Maybe each month could be represented in the month of their birth.

We'll need to finish this early enough to have them printed by an online printing service like [VistaPrint's](https://www.vistaprint.ca/photo-gifts/calendars/wall-calendars/templates?)
