We'll design a book cover layout using an ad hoc page layout grid. This is really fun because it's a blend of spontaneity and structure.

The tools we have at our disposal are:

[The Foundational Space](subpage1.html)
: The page. The page is our foundational space. We need to take the geometry of our page into consideration to achieve harmony in the final product.

[Type Selection](subpage2.html)
: One type family is all we'll need here. The goal is to use minimal instances of the family because we'll make use of other tools to achieve hierarchy.

[Type Styling](subpage3.html)
: This is where the rubber hits the road. We'll use size, weight, alignment, proximity, case, greys (no colour) and more to achieve hierarchy and to establish a clear reading order.

[Build Our Page](subpage4.html)
: As if we were cooks in a kitchen, we'll combine all the ingredients above to create a delicious typographic dish.
