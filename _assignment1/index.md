## The Brief

Before we can build a whole fiction novel, we need to pitch a design to our client. To that end, we'll design and build a two-page spread that includes one of each of the elements that will be in our final publication.

This will include the following considerations:

[Designing our Grid](subpage1.html)
: We'll design a single-column grid using the Van de Graaf Canon.

[Type Selection](subpage2.html)
: As is the custom in such publications, we'll work with only one serif typeface. It'll be crucial that it contains a broad variety of glyphs.

[Styling Our Type](subpage3.html)
: This is a lot of the heavy lifting, where attention to detail is vital. We'll style each element our content demands.

[Putting It All Together](subpage4.html)
: This is the mechanical work to be done after all the design work is complete. There's little creativity here. This is about assembling all the design elements in an InDesign document.
