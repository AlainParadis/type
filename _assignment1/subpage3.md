Much like a cooking show, this is where you're going to lay out your ingredients for me to see. Gather them all on a tabloid-sized page you'll save as a PDF to show me for approval. These include:

Type selection
: You should limit the number of families to two, if possible. You'll have all the text on the back and flaps, then you have your type-based artwork on the cover. Be sure to select families that have a variety of weights and widths.

: You should include your type treatment on your style board.

Colour palette
: The more focused your colour palette is the better. Select colours, then create tints and shades if needed. Remember, you can use sites like [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel).

Style samples
: Create snippets of graphics that will communicate the style you're going for.

This style board is for your client (me). I should be able to envision your design even if I'm not a designer.
