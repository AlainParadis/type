Not very many people in our blue and green marble can distinguish Arial from Helvetic. It's really a prized talent. I've pulled a few glyphs from each family to give you a hand.

![Arial Vs. Helvetica]({{site.url}}/svg/type-facts-repo/arial-vs-helvetica.svg "Arial Vs Helvetica"){:width="500px"}

If it's Helvetica, its **a** has a tail. Arial's does not. Arial has angled terminals. Helvetica does not. For Arial, leg of the capital **R** straight. Helvetica's leg is all curvy.

Now you know!
