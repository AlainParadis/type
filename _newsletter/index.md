This publication will have no photos or graphics to create variety on the page. We'll have to do that with the type only. The second major consideration is that this is meant to be a highly-functional design in that it's a user manual. We'll really need to consider how it's used in the real world.

This will include the following considerations:

[Designing our Grid](subpage1.html)
: The complexity of the grid increases here. We're going to design a multi-column grid.

[Type Selection](subpage2.html)
: We'll pair two type families -- a serif for the body copy and a sans-serif for the titles.

[Type Hierarchy](subpage3.html)
: A user manual contains chapters, sections and more. Clear hierarchy will be vital to good document organization.

[Page Element Design](subpage4.html)
: The design needs to be consistent across pages. The design of the page elements is yet another ingredient that gets us there.

[Assembly Work](subpage5.html)
: Now that the design work is complete, we'll assemble our publication using the provided content.
