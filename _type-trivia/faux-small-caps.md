Faux small caps happen when we scale down a capital letter to the same x-height as a lower case letter. What happens here is that the weight of the glyph gets scaled down too much compared to the lower-case letter next to it.

When a font doesn't contain a small cap, some page layout software scales down the glyph. This causes a faux small cap.

Note that small caps are sometimes slightly larger than the x-height of the lower case glyphs. There are also **petite caps**, which are exactly the same x-height as the lower case glyphs.
