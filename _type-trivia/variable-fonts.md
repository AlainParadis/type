### What Are They?

Variable fonts are a new file format based on OpenType that allows the user to control all the design variants, called *axis*. There's weight, width, italic, slant and optical size. Apple, Adobe, Microsoft and Google all worked on the development of the format.

Designers can use variable fonts in design applications like InDesign, Illustrator or Photoshop. They can also be used for web site and mobile app development.

You have variable fonts on your Mac now! We can launch InDesign to test them out.
