To use Oldstyle figures, find the OpenType setting in your Paragraph Style or in the OpenType panel.

Oldstyle figures have become much more common with the use of the OpenType font format. This format allows for 1024 glyphs in the font. Before that, the common limit was 128 glyphs, so there was just no room for them.
