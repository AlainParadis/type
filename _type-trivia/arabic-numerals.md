The numbers we use every day are called arabic numerals because they originated in Arab North Africa. It was Italian scholar Leonardo Fibonacci who popularized them in Europe.

<div style="font-size: 4rem;">
0&nbsp;1&nbsp;2&nbsp;3&nbsp;4&nbsp;5&nbsp;6&nbsp;7&nbsp;8&nbsp;9
</div>

Just be grateful we're not using roman numerals, where 1969 would be written MCMLXIX.
