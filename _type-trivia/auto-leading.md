Auto leading is a feature that allows your design software to automatically assign a leading value to the text you set, based on its point size. Most design software programs use a default auto leading setting of 120 percent of the point size. (This value can be changed by the user, as can most default values.)

In many cases, the use of auto leading results in a fractional value. For example, for 10 point type, the auto leading might be a nice, even 12 point; but for 11 point type, it becomes 13.2; for 12, it is 14.4; and for 14, it is 16.8. Most current design programs indicate the actual auto-leading value in the leading field, usually in parentheses; others don't show it at all.

Pros and Cons

Auto leading can be a real convenience when working with text type. By using auto leading, you can change text sizes as many times as you like and the leading will adjust proportionally and automatically. This is a real time-saver when you are unsure of your final point size and want the freedom to experiment.

On the other hand, auto leading does have its pitfalls; follow these guidelines to know when to use it and when to lose it:

When you are combining type, symbols, or dingbats of different point sizes on the same line, auto leading can wreak havoc with the line spacing in a text block, making one line jump to adjust to the larger glyph. To avoid this sometimes unexpected and usually unwanted occurrence, be sure to use a fixed leading. (Now you know why lines of type can mysteriously "jump" when you add a differently sized element to a block of copy!)

Converting auto leading to a fixed value also ensures that the leading won't change if the document is opened on another computer with different default settings.

While auto leading can facilitate the setting of body text, it is not as useful for display type. Display (or headline) type in larger sizes needs a lot less leading than text (see illustrations). This is especially true with all-cap settings that have no descenders to fill in the space between the lines. For display type, auto-leading settings will generally be way off the mark. Use your eye, not your software, to make larger type settings visually appropriate.
