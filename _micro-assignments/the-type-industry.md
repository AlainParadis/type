How does a font go from the typographer's mind to the market, to your page?

### The Typographer

Typographers actually design typefaces. The start with a purpose or reason for a type design. What problem does it solve? What use-case hasn't been solved that this design will solve? Is the type meant for long text or headlines? Is it to mimic a old typewriter or a broad-tipped pen?

#### Historical Context

Type cannot be designed ignoring the centuries of typographic history. There's a historical context that needs to be considered. In which category will the design belong -- old style, modern, slab, sans?

#### The Nitty Gritty

Typographers, like all designers, start with sketching individual glyphs and their stand-out features. There are certain letters which lend themselves as good starting points like the **s** and the **n**. There are words like **Handgloves** which contain letters which represent a wide range of typographic features, like ascenders, descenders, overshoots, etc...

#### Type Design Software

Once the designer has reached the limit of sketching, there are font design apps like [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com) and [FontLab](https://www.fontlab.com). There are others. This is where all the fine details can be implemented.

When designing a typeface, there are other considerations beyond the glyphs. There's side-bearing and kerning. There are alternate glyphs, swashes, [diacritics](https://www.type-together.com/understanding-diacritics) and more.

There are typefaces created for corporate use and some for general sale.

#### Design Quality

There *are* poor quality and superior quality designs, as in everything. Designing typefaces is incredibly detailed, painstaking work. Neglecting such details can lead to a typeface that is missing needed features or lacks finesse. That said, there may be a place for such type. It all depends on context.
