We have our grid established and our type family chosen. Now we can determine more styling like styling folios, chapter names and numbers and more.

### Ornaments

Depending on the context, ornaments can create a visual break in reading and enhance the appearance of our pages.

### Alternates

Stylistic alternates can add elegance or ease-of-reading to our text. Conversely, we need to careful that they're not more of a distraction.

### Ligatures

Ligatures can ease flow when reading. As with alternates, they can be distracting.

### Old Style Figures

These figures add style and legibility to numbers. There's more differentiation between digits.
