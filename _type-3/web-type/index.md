Develop a responsive type system.

- Choose from one of the provided themes.
- Choose two families, serif and sans-serif.
- Create hierarchy for:
  - 3 levels of headings
  - Body copy
  - Links
  - Unordered lists
  - Ordered lists
  - Block quotes
- Create a colour theme.
  - First colour should be bold.
  - Second colour is tamer.
  - Create tints and/or shades.
  - These need to be expressed in either hex, RGB, HSL (no transparency is necessary).
- Choose from either:
  - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
  - [TypeKit](https://fonts.adobe.com) (Adobe Fonts)
  - [WOFF fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/WOFF)
- Responsiveness:
  - Info on [media queries](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/media-queries/)
  - Line length should not exceed 40em (640px).
  - Type needs to scale for smaller - larger screen dimensions.

You'll build an actual web page. The layout isn't really important, nor assessed, though you can feel free to create one. What's important is that the hierarchy is clearly shown.
