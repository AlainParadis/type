### The Perfect Page 

J.A. van de Graaf created the Van de Graaf Canon. This is a formula to create a harmonious single-column pages.

We'll draw this grid together.

Using these guides, no matter the dimensions of the pages, the margins will always have the same ratio. This creates margins with a ratio of: inner margin 2, top margin 3, outer margin 4, and bottom margin 6, or 2:3:4:6. We can also express this as 1/9 and 2/9 of the page.

There are other page layout canons. You can [see them here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canons_of_page_construction){:target="_blank"}.
