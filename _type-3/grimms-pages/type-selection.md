Legibility is the focus when choosing a typeface for a long publication. We'll choose a **serif** type family designed for such an application. There are times when you can use a sans-serif for a long document, but not in a fiction novel. Our choice needs to have a large compliment of OpenType features such as ligatures, small caps, old style numerals and alternate glyphs.

We want to make sure the colour of the page is uniform. Type size, width and weight as well as leading has a large bearing on this.

There's on old adage by typesetters that says, *When in doubt, choose Caslon*. So let's avoid Caslon altogether.

### Properties to Seek Out

The features below are not all required, but they are good to have. It all depends on context.

We'll need to do research to know which typefaces are suitable for a long fiction text, like Caslon, but not Caslon.
