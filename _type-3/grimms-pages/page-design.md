### Design Your Page

#### Option #1: The Perfect Page 

There are many formula for creating the single-column grid. Most of them are trash, myths. There are others which are actually useful. The first is the Van de Graaf Canon. Let's dive in!

J.A. van de Graaf created the Van de Graaf Canon. This is a formula to create a harmonious single-column pages.

We'll draw this grid together.

![Example of a single-column grid]({{site.url}}/svg/van-de-graaf-canon.svg "Example of a single-column grid")

Using these guides, no matter the dimensions of the pages, the margins will always have the same ratio. This creates margins with a ratio of: inner margin 2, top margin 3, outer margin 4, and bottom margin 6, or 2:3:4:6. We can also express this as 1/9 and 2/9 of the page.

There are other page layout canons. You can [see them here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canons_of_page_construction){:target="_blank"}.

We'll draw a grid on given page dimensions.

#### Option #2: The Economical Approach

Here, we're going to take a more practical approach to our page layout. All we need is enough margins to accommodate the binding on the inside, our thumbs on the outside, running headers at the top and folios at the bottom.

### The Colour of the Page

The phrase *colour of the page* doesn't literally refer to colour itself. It refers to what the page looks like if you print one, hold it at arm's length, then blur your vision. How light or dark grey is the page? The density of the content is the colour of the page. There are many factors that affect page colour, type selection, type weight, leading and letter-spacing. See some examples in this PDF.

[![See the colour of the page in this PDF file.]({{site.url}}/svg/button-download-pdf.svg "See the colour of the page in this PDF file."){:width="200px"}](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b3zqqafvrb8jv8e/colour-of-the-page.pdf?dl=1)

> Your page should have 25 to 32 lines of text. Consult the Info panel for the numbers.

The goal is to create a harmonious page, free of distracting graphic elements.

#### Composition

With no document open, open the settings for your <span class="commmand">Basic Paragraph</span> style. Go to <span class="command">Justification</span> to enter this.

|          | Minimum   |   Desired   |   Maximum   |
|:--------:|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------:|
|   Word Spacing   |   96%   |   100%   |   104%   |
|    Letter Spacing   |   -3%   |   0%   |   3%   |
|   Glyph Scaling   |   96%   | 100%   |   104%   |

Set <span class="command">Single Word Justification</span> to <span class="command">Align Left</span>.

These numbers are a starting point. They're not written in stone. They're better than what Adobe set as defaults, but if they don't work for you, adjust them.

![InDesign Composition Highlighting]({{site.url}}/svg/indesign-composition-highlighting.svg "InDesign Composition Highlighting."){:width="320px"}

You'll know you're settings are incorrect if there is yellow highlighting on your InDesign pages. You can see bad and good justified text in the PDF file linked below.

[![See good vs bad Justification.]({{site.url}}/svg/button-download-pdf.svg "See good vs bad Justification."){:width="200px"}](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tceqy4n160vpwsn/good-vs-bad-justification.pdf?dl=1)


#### Rivers

Rivers are unfortunate spaces which vertically span lines of text. They're mostly a thing of the past. InDesign takes care of this for us. [This is what they look like](http://www.edgee.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/justified_rivers.png){:target="_blank"}, just in case.

#### Hyphenation

In your body copy paragraph style, be sure to go to your Hyphenation settings. Change them to:

|   Words with at least   |   6   |   letters   |
|   After first   |   3   |   letters   |
|   Before last   |   3   |   letters   |
|   Hyphen limit   |   2   |   hyphens   |

Un-check all the check boxes.

Hyphenation zone is irrelevant with justified type.

#### Optical Margin Alignment

With no document open, go <span class="command">Window > Type & Tables > Story</span>. In that panel, check the box, then set the type size to 9, which is an average body copy point size.

![InDesign Story Panel optical alignment]({{site.url}}/svg/story-panel-optical-alignment.svg){:width="320px"}

This will make text on the left margin hang out of the text frame to create an optically aligned margin. Though it may look strange here, when it's at a normal size, it makes the edge of the text actually look straight.

#### Widows & Orphans

We can use InDesign's settings to get rid of *most* widows and orphans. The rest we must fix manually. We'll explore <span class="command">Keep Options</span> in your Paragraph Style for the body copy.

### Stylistic Elements

#### Ornaments

![Wood Type Ornament]({{site.url}}/svg/ornaments.svg){:width="180px"}

Ornaments are actually glyphs that are part of a font. The simplest way to choose one is to select a font, then open the glyphs panel to get a list. A majority of fonts don't have ornaments. They're a lot of work for the typographer to design.

If you want to see an impressive array of ornaments, take a gander at [this PDF with details on the Warnock family](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/products/type/pdfs/WarnockPro.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Be sure to read how the story of the typeface began in the PDF. It'll surely bring a tear to your eye.

Depending on the context, ornaments can create a visual break in reading and enhance the appearance of our pages.

#### Alternates

![Alternate Characters]({{site.url}}/svg/alternates.svg){:width="180px"}

Stylistic alternates can add elegance or ease-of-reading to our text. Conversely, we need to careful that they're not more of a distraction.

#### Ligatures

![Sample Ligature]({{site.url}}/svg/ligatures.svg){:width="240px"}

Ligatures can ease flow when reading. As with alternates, they can be distracting.

#### Old Style Figures

![Old Style Figures]({{site.url}}/svg/old-style-figures.svg){:width="180px"}

Old style figures, also known as non-lining figures are shifted relative to the baseline. These figures add style and legibility to numbers. There's more differentiation between digits.

#### By the way...

This is what I meant by distracting ligatures.
