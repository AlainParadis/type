### What's on the Board

### Prepare Your Text

Copy and paste the text from the web page to a text editor, not into InDesign. You'll want to use the Find/Change command in your text editor to remove:

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>double spaces</li>
	<li>double paragraph breaks</li>
	<li>any tab characters</li>
</ul>

If ever your text happens to have giant, long paragraphs, find a logical spot to add a paragraph break.

Read through your story. When I read mine, there were question marks missing in the quotations. Also, add quotation marks throughout the text where people are speaking. This is how to apply them. Note where the punctuation is in the different examples.

> "Birds of a feather flock together, let us remain together, and seek our way."

> "I don't know that myself", answered the huntsman, "I have lost my way in the forest".

See how the punctuation is sometimes on the inside of the quote marks and sometimes on the outside? If the whole sentence is a spoken one, the quotes go on the outside. If not, they go on the inside.
