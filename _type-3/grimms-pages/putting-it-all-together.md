### What's on the Board

This is what we have put together to date:

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>our page grid</li>
	<li>typeface selection</li>
	<li>stylistic elements</li>
</ul>

We don't have colour selection to do, since we're working with only black ink.

> The black ink in a novel is C0 M0 Y0 K100. It's only black ink. If you look closely (especially with a loupe), you can see that it's grey-ish on the page. That way, it's actually easier on the eyes. The contrast is too high on really black ink on super-white paper.

From here on in, it's just a matter of assembly. Now we become the production department.
