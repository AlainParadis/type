Legibility is the focus when choosing a font for a long publication. We'll choose a serif type family designed for such an application. Our choice needs to have a large compliment of OpenType features such as ligatures, small caps, old style numerals and alternate glyphs.

We want to make sure the colour of the page is uniform. Type size and weight as well as leading has a large bearing on this.
