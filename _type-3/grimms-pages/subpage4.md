We have our grid established and our type family chosen. Now we can determine more styling like styling folios, chapter names and numbers and more.

### Ornaments

Ornaments are actually glyphs that are part of a font. The simplest way to choose one is to select a font, then open the glyphs panel to get a list. A majority of fonts don't have ornaments. They're a lot of work for the typographer to design.

If you want to see an impressive array of ornaments, take a gander at [this PDF with details on the Warnock family](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/products/type/pdfs/WarnockPro.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Be sure to read how the story of the typeface began in the PDF. It'll surely bring a tear to your eye.

Depending on the context, ornaments can create a visual break in reading and enhance the appearance of our pages.

### Alternates

Stylistic alternates can add elegance or ease-of-reading to our text. Conversely, we need to careful that they're not more of a distraction.

### Ligatures

Ligatures can ease flow when reading. As with alternates, they can be distracting.

### Old Style Figures

Old style figures, also known as non-lining figures are shifted relative to the baseline. These figures add style and legibility to numbers. There's more differentiation between digits.

### By the way...

This is what I meant by distracting ligatures.
