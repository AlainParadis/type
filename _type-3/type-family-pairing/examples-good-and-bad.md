### A Good Match

In this first case, I was given Mrs Eaves as the typeface for body text. It's a challenging face to work with, since it has a tiny x-height. This requires that we choose a weight for Franklin that doesn't over-power Mrs Eaves.

I'd characterize this pairing as a bold or a strong one. Franklin is a powerful typeface. Mrs Eaves is delicate. As you can see at the bottom-right, Franklin Gothic Heavy is just that â€” too heavy. So what we can learn here is that font pairing is not only about choosing a second face that doesn't clash. It's also about creating an effect. In this case, the pairing works, but there's a clear contrast in effect.

### A Poor Match

Again, I was given Mrs Eaves for body text. ITC's Avant Garde is a poor match.

This is why:

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>Their general appearance just clashes.</li>
	<li>Avant Garde is a geometric sans. Mrs Eaves has a calligraphic style. The sans could be termed <em>computer-generated</em>, while the serif is reminiscent of a pen work.</li>
	<li>Avant Garde has a single storey g and a. Mrs Eaves has two storey g and a.</li>
	<li>Avant Garde has a huge x-height. Eaves has a tiny x-height.</li>
</ul>

That is all. Got it?
