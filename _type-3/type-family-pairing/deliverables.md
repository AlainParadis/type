### Presentation

Two students will present their findings to the group at the start of each class. I'll give you your due dates in class.

You'll share your findings with the group at the start of class. This should be a short explanation of your findings. You're basically verbally presenting what you've written in your layout. Just don't read it. Know the content, then communicate it to us.

### Package It Up!

Make sure your InDesign file is in good shape, save, then package it, including a PDF file.

I'll share each PDF file with the group so you have good pairings to use in your work.
