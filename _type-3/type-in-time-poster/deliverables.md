Before you submit, be sure to go through the assignment pages to ensure you've followed all the instructions.

### Submission

#### Printed

Print your final poster in colour. Include bleeds and the file info on your output. No envelope is needed. I'll have one in class.

#### Digital

Name your Illustrator document like this:

**appleseed-johnny-010-poster.ai**

> Never rename a file while it's open. Close it. Rename it in Finder, then re-open it.

Use Illustrator's Package function, <span class="command">File > Package...</span>. Name the package folder like so, **appleseed-johnny-010-poster**

Then add a PDF file to the folder. Zip, then submit.
