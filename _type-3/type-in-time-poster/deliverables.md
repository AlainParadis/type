Before you submit, be sure to go through the assignment pages to ensure you've followed all the instructions.

### Submission

Name your InDesign document like this:

**appleseed-johnny-010-poster.indd**

Use InDesign's Package function. Name the package folder like so:

**appleseed-johnny-010-poster**

Zip, then submit.

> Never rename a file while it's open. Close it. Rename it in Finder, then re-open it.

When you package your InDesign document with <span class="command">File > Package...</span> It will create a folder that's properly named if your file was well named to start with.
