Once we've done our exploration of [type classifications]({{ site.baseurl }}/kb/classification-categories.html), the ball's going to be in your court. Pour through type families that are representative of a given era or classification.

**Choose a family that is a mainstay of that particular classification.** Avoid minor, little-known typefaces.

Tell the reason for your choice. No B.S. Make it honest. Take your time. What is it that appealed to you about this family? Don't worry, it doesn't need to be some deep historical thing, though it *can* be.

Do your research. Make your choice, then tell me.

#### Colour Treatment

The fewer colours you use, the more focused your design will be. You *could* design this in a single colour with its tints and shades, or one colour plus black. If you choose two colours, the first should be a prominent colour. The second can be *quieter*. Too many colours will distract from the subject of the poster, the type design.

#### Production Specifications

These are pretty simple.
