### Informal Grids

The use of informal grids is the main purpose of this assignment. Informal grids are created as you sketch your pages. They don't have the rhythmic structure the other types of grids have. There aren't columns. Elements simply align with each other on the page.

### What Are They Good For?

These are best used for single-page designs like a book cover, a sign or a poster. We'd never use this type of grid for a whole publication.

### How do they work?

Your page is the canvas you have to work with. Remember that in the west, our eyes travel on the page from the top left to the bottom right. What we want to do is direct the eye more specifically by aligning page elements to each other. The goal is to create visual flow on the page.

As we build our layout, we create hierarchy for each element using size, weight, etc... Once each element is styled, we place the most important one thoughtfully on the page. From there, we can place the other elements in order of descending importance.

In the example above, you can see that the main title logically takes the lead in the layout. The two remaining elements align with it. You can see how, even with so few elements, we've achieved harmony on the page.

It's also obvious that the process of creating a layout in this manner is too tedious for long multi-page publications. That's what modular grids are for.

Be sure to change this important setting in Illustrator before you set any type.

### Let's Practice

Let's launch Illustrator to practice creating a layout with an informal grid. Start with activating one of the following families on Adobe Fonts.

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/baskerville-urw" title="Baskerville" target="_blank">Baskerville URW</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/bodoni-urw" title="Bodoni" target="_blank">Bodoni URW</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/adobe-caslon" title="Caslon" target="_blank">Adobe Caslon</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/garamond-premier" title="Adobe Garamond Premier" target="_blank">Adobe Garamond Premier</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/itc-franklin-gothic" title="ITC Franklin Gothic" target="_blank">ITC Franklin Gothic</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/acumin" title="Acumin" target="_blank">Adobe Acumin</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/gill-sans-nova" title="Gill Sans Nova" target="_blank">Gill Sans Nova</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/itc-avant-garde-gothic" title="ITC Avant Garde" target="_blank">ITC Avant Garde</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/futura-pt" title="Futur" target="_blank">Futura PT</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/rockwell" title="Rockwell">Rockwell Monotype</a></li>
</ul>

Activate your chosen type family. Create an Illustrator document. Let's try a 10" square page. Choose and set up your margins.

I'm going to choose a title *Man's Best Friend*. A sub-title *Are dogs really man's best friend? How did this come to be?* Then a block of body copy.

<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zixxh4b1lnmx4oi/mans-best-friend.txt?dl=1" title="Download the text file for this practice assignment" target="_blank">![Download Files]({{site.url}}/svg/button-download.svg){:width="50%"}</a>

The whole idea of the informal grid is that we set one page element after another, starting with the most important. So let's set the title.

These are some variables you can work with:

<ul class="hasBullets columns3">
	<li>size</li>
	<li>weight</li>
	<li>width</li>
	<li>case</li>
	<li>greys</li>
	<li>strokes</li>
	<li>columns</li>
	<li>diagonal</li>
	<li>italics</li>
	<li>reversed</li>
</ul>


Now we'll set the sub-title. It needs to appear noticeably less important than the title. Alignment is important here. That's the informal grid at work.

The last item is the block of body copy. Make sure to set proper leading and reasonable hyphenation.

Once you're done, save your work, then save a copy of your file as a Print Ready PDF file.

We'll do a quick critique of the result.
