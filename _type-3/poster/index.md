Once we've done our exploration of type classifications, the ball's going to be in your court. Pour through type families that are representative of a given era or classification.

Tell the reason for your choice. No B.S. Make it honest. Take your time. What is it that appealed to you about this family? Don't worry, it doesn't need to be some deep historical thing, though it *can* be.

If it were me, I'd chose Kinesis as a glyphic serif. Take a sec to go check out the lower case g glyph in [Kinesis Italic](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/kinesis). Zoom in. Crazy, eh? The p glyph is no slouch either.

Do your research. Make your choice, then tell me.
