The odds are good you've done this assignment in Illustrator. If so, you'll want to name your file:

**last-name-first-name-group-number-project.ai** or

**appleseed-johnny-010-poster.ai**

Create a PDF named the same way.

**appleseed-johnny-010-poster.pdf**

Put them in a folder named:

**appleseed-johnny-010-poster**

Zip the whole thing and submit.

### InDesign

If ever you did this in InDesign, make sure you name it the same way as above. Then simply package your InDesign document.

**appleseed-johnny-010-poster.indd**

Folder:

**appleseed-johnny-010-poster**

Zip, then submit.

Please indicate **FINAL** in the Brightspace comments when you submit your final poster files.
