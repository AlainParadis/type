You will include the following on your poster. These are minimum requirements. You can include more if you come across it during your research.

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>Typographer's name</li>
	<li>Year of typeface design</li>
	<li>The classification category to which it belongs</li>
	<li>A waterfall of the instances that make up the family</li>
	<li>A block of paragraph text that describes the family</li>
	<li>A bio of the typographer in a block of paragraph text.</li>
	<li>Prominent display of stand-out glyphs from the family</li>
	<li>Any other useful information you find</li>
</ul>

No photos are allowed on your poster. You can use shapes and lines.

Avoid a copy/paste from a web site. What I propose is that you read about the typeface and it's designer. Take notes in your own words. Use those words on your poster.

Be sure the content is properly written and error-free.
