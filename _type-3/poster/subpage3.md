### Creative Process

Once you've chosen your type family, you should explore its glyph complement, its *repertoire*. You can see this in the Glyphs panel in either InDesign or Illustrator. You can even filter through glyphs by category. [<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/glyphs-special-characters.html" class="mono" >support link</a>] Hopefully there'll be some beauties in there you can highlight on your poster.

#### Thumbnails

Start with the traditional thumbnails. Since this is such a large poster, it's tough to make a small thumbnail represent the full-sized artwork. I suggest making your thumbnails a quarter of a letter sheet instead.

Produce lots. Show me. Rinse and repeat.

#### High(er)-Fidelity Rendering

Once you've refined your concepts, you can create a higher fidelity version of your poster. This can be on a full letter or tabloid sized sheet. Remember to use the proportions of the final poster. It measures 24" x 36". That's a 2:3 ratio, so you can make your high-fi rendering 6" by 9" on a letter sheet or 8" by 12" on a tabloid sheet.

This is what you'll base your final poster on. Once you have this done, the creative process is pretty much done. On to building it on your Mac.

### Software Process

You can build this poster either in InDesign or in Illustrator. The process will be very similar either way.

#### Illustrator: Point vs. Area Type

Remember our lesson from semester one. When you type short bits of text, use point type. Only use area type when you set a paragraph.

![Illustrator Point Type vs Area Type]({{site.url}}/svg/illustrator-point-area-type.svg "Illustrator Point Type vs Area Type"){:width="240px"}

You'll know if you have point type in Illustrator if the bounding box has an empty cicle on it vs an solid one. Of course, InDesign only has area type -- no point type.

It's a good idea to set up paragraph styles in either application so you can make quick changes with more consistency and fewer errors.
