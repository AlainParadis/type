### Creative Process

Once you've chosen your type family, you should explore its glyph complement, its *repertoire*. You can see this in the Glyphs panel in either InDesign or Illustrator. You can even filter through glyphs by category. [<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/glyphs-special-characters.html">support link</a>] Hopefully there'll be some beauties in there you can highlight on your poster.

#### Thumbnails

Start with the traditional thumbnails. Since this is such a large poster, it's tough to make a small thumbnail represent the full-sized artwork. I suggest making your thumbnails a quarter of a letter sheet instead.

Produce lots. Show me. Rinse and repeat.

#### High(er)-Fidelity Rendering

Once you've refined your concepts, you can create a higher fidelity version of your poster. This can be on a full letter or tabloid sized sheet. Remember to use the proportions of the final poster. It measures 24" x 36". That's a 2:3 ratio, so you can make your high-fi rendering 6" by 9" on a letter sheet or 8" by 12" on a tabloid sheet.

This is what you'll base your final poster on. Once you have this done, the creative process is pretty much done. On to building it on your Mac.

### Software Process

You can build this poster either in InDesign or in Illustrator. The process will be very similar either way.

#### Illustrator: Point vs. Area Type

Remember our lesson from semester one. When you type short bits of text, use point type. Only use area type when you set a paragraph.

![Illustrator Point Type vs Area Type]({{site.url}}/svg/illustrator-point-area-type.svg "Illustrator Point Type vs Area Type"){:width="240px"}

You'll know if you have point type in Illustrator if the bounding box has an empty cicle on it vs an solid one. Of course, InDesign only has area type -- no point type.

It's a good idea to set up paragraph styles in either application so you can make quick changes with more consistency and fewer errors.

### Design Approval

Create a single-page PDF mood board. If we were cooking, this would be all the ingredients laid out on the counter. From them, we could see what the dish will be. It should include:

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>colour swatches</li>
	<li>type specimens</li>
	<li>a small sample of the type treatment</li>
</ul>
