### Prepare Your Text

Be sure to remove double spaces, double paragraph breaks, any useless tab characters and any other text elements that don't need to be there


### InDesign Work

The important work is done at the outset. Document setup, margin setup and Parent Pages (previously called Master Pages) are where the action happens.

You'll want to create your pages to fit the dust cover you just completed. Remember that the front of the trimmed dust cover measured 12cm wide by 20cm tall. That means that each page will need to be three or four millimetres smaller than the cover. You need to figure out your dimensions.

You can create a document with a few pages, then add more as needed to accomodate the length of your story.

Now you need to set up text frames on Parent Pages and style sheets.

### Story Jumps and Enders

When a story jumps from one page to another, we need to direct the reader to the story's continuation. This is where the story jump becomes useful.

We also need to indicate when the story ends. This is where we can insert a small graphic to indicate the story does not continue on another page.
