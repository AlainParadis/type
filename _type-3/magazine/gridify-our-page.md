### Criteria for your pages

Your pages must:

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>use the A4 page dimensions.</li>
	<li>have all elements aligned to column guides.</li>
	<li>either <em>left-aligned</em> or <em>left-justified</em> text.</li>
	<li>have all body copy aligned to the baseline.</li>
	<li>have adequate margins, inside, outside, top and bottom.</li>
</ul>

### The Modular Grid

Our magazine dimensions are going to be A4 size, that's 21cm x 29.7cm. This is our canvas. The grid needs to allow for:

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>Margins</li>
		<li class="second">Top: Running Headers</li>
		<li class="second">Outside: Thumb space</li>
		<li class="second">Inside: Binding</li>
		<li class="second">Bottom: Folios</li>
	<li>Columns</li>
		<li class="second">Reasonable line length</li>
	<li>Gutters</li>
		<li class="second">Breathing room between columns</li>
</ul>

### Your Grid

I suggest you divide your page into 6 columns. That way, you can mostly use them as a three columns, with halves built-in

### Bleeds

When you place text and artwork on the page, it either needs to be within the margins or reach out to the bleed line *accurately*. The bleed must be ⅛" or 0p9, which are equivalents.

{% include /svg/bleeds.svg %}

Don't leave any artwork beyond the bleed line.

### Text Alignment

Your text can either be left-justified or left aligned. Choose one alignment for all your pages.

{% include /svg/text-alignment-left-j-a.svg %}


#### Baseline Grids

You must align your body copy to the baseline grid. The baseline grid is a set of guides on which can align body copy so text baselines align from column to column. It makes the pages look a lot cleaner—more orderly.

{% include /svg/baseline-grid.svg %}{:width="600px"}

We can have text aligned to the baseline whether it's left-aligned or left-justified. You **do not** need to align titles or any other text to the baseline grid.

### Sketching Pages

You'll need to sketch page layouts. I usually print pages with a grid on them to guide me in my sketching. It also helps that the proportions are the same as my final printed piece.
