We'll be using InDesign and optionally Illustrator to create your design.

Create a strokes-only outline similar to the one on this page with the provided dimensions. Save it as a native Illustrator file (.ai).

{% include /svg/dust-cover-wireframe.svg %}

## Which Apps?

We want to make the most of both Illustrator and InDesign. 

We'll create a template to contain our work in Illustrator, as shown above. We'll import it into InDesign. All vector content can be created in the Illustrator file. All body copy elements will be in InDesign. We're doing this because InDesign is better at setting type. Illustrator is better at illustrating!

**Never copy/paste content from Illustrator to InDesign. Use File > Place instead.**
