We'll design a book cover layout using an ad hoc page layout grid. This is really fun because it's a blend of spontaneity and structure. Ad hoc, or *informal* grids are created as you sketch your pages. Elements simply align with each other on the page.

### Project Stages

1. Read through the web site pages for this assignment.
1. Read through the [Grimm Fairy Tales](http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~spok/grimmtmp/){:target="_blank"} to make a selection.
1. Research your fairy tale's meaning, message, moral to find a theme for your design. **Avoid the short, single-paragraph stories.**
1. Research (two) font families you think will be appropriate to the story. You can optionally add a display typeface for your title
1. [Submit your proposal here.](https://forms.office.com/r/SVwCcPScRp)
1. Design your [style board](layout-ingredients.html).
1. [Sketch](layout-ingredients.html) thumbnails & a full-size rendering of your design.
1. Get approval for your concept from me.
1. Build your design.

### Project Parameters

Make sure you read through all the requirements.

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>You'll need to design the cover, the back and the two flaps based on the provided measurements.</li>
	<li>This is going to be a type-only design. <em>No images allowed</em>.</li>
	<li>Use the provided bar code and logos.</li>

### Your Design Approach

You have the freedom to interpret your fairy tale however you wish. The facts of the story cannot be changed. You can, however, give it a different spin. For instance, you could treat it as a sci-fi story. It could be a romance or a horror story. You can imagine how the aesthetics of each of these would be very different. **Your approach must suit the story**. It needs to make sense.
