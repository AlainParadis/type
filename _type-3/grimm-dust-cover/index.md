We'll design a book cover layout using an ad hoc page layout grid. This is really fun because it's a blend of spontaneity and structure. Ad hoc, or *informal* grids are created as you sketch your pages. Elements simply align with each other on the page.

## Outcomes

By the time you've completed this assignment, you will have learned to:

- Inventory, organize and prepare provided materials to use in a design.
- Sketch page layouts on paper as thumbnails and higher fidelity mockups.
- Implement a design with an ad hoc grid.
- Make a reasoned font pairing which suits a given theme.
- Produce print-ready files.
