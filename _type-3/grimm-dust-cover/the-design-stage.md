### Style Board

Much like a cooking show, this is where you're going to lay out your ingredients for me to see. Gather them all on a tabloid-sized page you'll save as a PDF to show me for approval. These include:

Type selection
: You should limit the number of families to two, if possible. You'll have all the text on the back and flaps, then you have your type-based artwork on the cover. Be sure to select families that have a variety of weights and widths.

: You should include your type treatment on your style board.

Colour palette
: The more focused your colour palette is the better. Select colours, then create tints and shades if needed. Remember, you can use sites like [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel).

Style samples
: Create snippets of graphics that will communicate the style you're going for.

This style board is for your client (me). I should be able to envision your design even if I'm not a designer.

### Sketch Your Layout

The style board above lays out the ingredients for your design. The sketches help you decide where they go. Start with thumbnails to quickly get your ideas on the page. Once you have some you think work, draw them at a size closer to the final product.

This is a good stage to show me your work.
