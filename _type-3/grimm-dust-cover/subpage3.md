We'll be using InDesign and optionally Illustrator to create your design.

Create an strokes-only outline similar to the one on this page with the provided dimensions. Save it as a native Illustrator file (.ai).

Create an InDesign document in which we'll import the above Illustrator file. The placed Illustrator file needs to be on its own InDesign layer. This is the template on which we'll create our design.

All the basic text content will be created in InDesign. Only use Illustrator when necessary.
