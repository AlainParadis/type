### One of Each

You're going to need a serif and a sans-serif family for this project. This pairing is crucial to the success of your piece. Be sure to choose families which work well together, and also have a variety of weights and widths.

You are also allowed a display typeface. This one is to be used in a very limited fashion. It's not made to set long lengths of text. It could be used for the book title or other short bits of text.

The type selection will also need to be appropriate to your interpretation of the story. You must choose a theme from your story which can be represented visually in your design.

### Go With Your Theme

Be sure to choose a theme that suits your story. For instance, Hansel & Gretel could easily be interpreted as a horror story. The thematic approach you choose will inform your type selection. A romantic approach will look much different than a horror or a sci-fi one.
