### Style Board

Much like a cooking show, this is where you're going to lay out your ingredients for me to see. Gather them all on a tabloid-sized page you'll save as a PDF to show me for approval. These include:

Type selection
: You should limit the number of families to two, if possible. You'll have all the text on the back and flaps, then you have your type-based artwork on the cover. Be sure to select families that have a variety of weights and widths.

: You must include your type treatment and hierarchy on your style board.

Colour palette
: The more focused your colour palette is the better. We don't need to see tints and shades here. Show the two main colours in your design. Remember, you can use sites like [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel).

Style samples
: Create snippets of graphics that will communicate the style you're going for.

Your Synopsis
: Include a short summary of the story on your style board. Additionally, you should explain the moral or message in your selected text.

Descriptors
: Include a minimum of 4 words which describe your story and its mood.

This style board is for your client (me). I should be able to envision your design even if I'm not a designer.

> Do not design the layout on your style boardâ€”only the ingredients.

### Sketch Your Layout

The style board above lays out the ingredients for your design. The sketches help you decide where they go. Start with thumbnails to quickly get your ideas on the page. Once you have some you think work, draw them at a size closer to the final product.

> These must be hand-drawn on paper or on a tablet. No mice allowed!

You should have multiple pages of hand-drawn sketches. There should be clear progress towards a concept as you go. Once you have a concept with which you're satisfied, take clear photos at a right angle to your pages. Save them in a multipage PDF file.
