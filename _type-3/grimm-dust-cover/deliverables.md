### Prepare Print-Ready Files

All the assignments you submit in Typography courses should be print ready. This is what you have to check before packaging your files.

#### File Organization

As you work, keep your files organized in a project folder. You should have your main page layout file, then a folder for images. You may also keep a folder in your project folder for raw/original files, which you **do not** submit to me.

> You will always simply submit a packaged folder including a PDF file for all assignments.

#### Colours

##### Spot Colour

If the project requires that you use spot colours, those should be the only colours in your files. This includes the main InDesign document and in linked files. Empty your swatches panel of all unused colours.

##### Process Colour

When the project calls for process colour (or four colour process), there should be no spot colours in any of the files you submit. Empty your swatches panel of all unused colours.

#### Font files

As we'll only be using Adobe Fonts, there's not much to do here. No fonts will ever be packaged with your projects, so you have nothing to worry about.
