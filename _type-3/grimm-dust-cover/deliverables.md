### Prepare Print-Ready Files

All the assignments you submit in Typography courses should be print ready. This is what you have to check before packaging your files.

#### File Organization

As you work, keep your files organized in a project folder. You should have your main page layout file.

> You will always simply submit a packaged folder including a PDF file for all assignments.

#### Process Colour

When the project calls for process colour (or four colour process), there should be no spot colours in any of the files you submit. Empty your swatches panel of all unused colours.

#### Font files

As we'll only be using Adobe Fonts, there's not much to do here. No fonts will ever be packaged with your projects, so you have nothing to worry about. Be sure to check <span class="command">Type > Find Fonts...</span> to ensure only the fonts you're using are in your document.

### Your Submission Folder

Be sure your InDesign document is named as usual:

**appleseed-johnny-010-dustcover.indd**

Note
: Never rename a file while it's open. Close it. Rename it in Finder, then re-open it.

#### Preflight!

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>Check Separations Preview in InDesign to ensure you have no spot colours.</li>
	<li>Check your links panel to make sure there are no ⚠️.</li>
	<li>Check <span class="command">Type > Find/Replace</span> font in InDesign to make sure only desired fonts are in the list.</li>
</ul>

When you package your InDesign document with <span class="command">File > Package...</span> It will create a folder that's properly named if your file was well named to start with.
