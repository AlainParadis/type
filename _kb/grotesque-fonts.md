You can use Grotesque as a synonym for sans-serif. The term is also used as a sub-category of sans-serif families.

So, in one case a Grotesque is a synonym for sans-serif.

In the second case, it's used more specifically as a sub-category of sans-serifs. Those categories are Grotesque, Neo-Grotesque, Geometric, and Humanist among some other sub-categories. I look at is everything that's sans-serif that's *not* Geometric nor Humanist. Franklin Gothic is the definitive Grotesque design.
