The ampersand glyph comes from the ligature of the letters **e** and **t**. It spelled the word **et**, which means **and** in latin. The two letters morphed with time into the one we know today.

The word ampersand itself came from the combination of **and per se**. This happened because the & was actually considered the last letter of the alphabet. In school, young kids would say the alphabet, then end with:

<div style="font-size: 2rem; font-family: 'firaSans-Italic'">x, y, z and per se and</div>

pronounced *and per say and*. That last part eventually became the word *ampersand*.
