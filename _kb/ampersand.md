The ampersand glyph comes from the ligature of the letters **e** and **t**. It spelled the word **et**, which means **and** in latin, and in French. The two letters morphed with time into the one we know today.

There are virtually infinite variants on the design of the ampersand.

### Its Origins

The word ampersand itself came from the combination of **and per se**. This happened because the & was actually considered the last letter of the alphabet. In school, young kids would say the alphabet, then end with:

<div style="font-size: 2rem; font-family: 'firaSans-Italic'">x, y, z and per se and</div>

pronounced *and per say and*. That last part eventually became the word *ampersand*. French *esperluette* may have a similar origin, *et per lui et*.

### Helpful Tech Tip

When you see the ampersand in your browser's URL bar, it's sometimes followed by information that can track you while you browse.

This is an example of what happens when you follow a link from Facebook. It appends the hash that identifies and tracks your movements on the web.

It's used for other purposes, too.
