The numbers we use ever day in the western world are called Arabic numerals. There are different ways of setting type with these figures.

![Old style lining figures]({{site.url}}/svg/oldstyle-lining-figures.svg "Old style lining figures"){:width="600px"}

Lining figures are most common. They don't fit very well in running text. It's like they're written in ALL CAPS. They stand out too much.

![Old style proportional figures]({{site.url}}/svg/oldstyle-proportional.svg "Old style proportional figures"){:width="600px"}


Proportional old style figures are an elegant addition to your typographic layout, if they're available in the font you've chosen. They're easier to read and flow better in running text. They look like they have ascenders and descenders like the rest of the glyphs in the text.

![Old style tabular figures]({{site.url}}/svg/oldstyle-tabular-figures.svg "Old style tabular figures"){:width="600px"}

![oldstyle-prop-tab]({{site.url}}/svg/oldstyle-prop-tab.svg "oldstyle-prop-tab"){:width="480px"}

Tabular old style figures are identical to the proportional old style figures, except that their letter-spacing is designed to accomodate columns of text. As you can see, the proportional figures don't align well in columns. The tabular ones do.

### How do I use them?

To use old style figures, find the OpenType setting in your Paragraph Style or in the OpenType panel.

Old style figures have become much more common with the use of the OpenType font format. This format allows for 1024 glyphs in the font. Before that, the common limit was 128 glyphs, so there was just no room for them.
