I've pulled a few glyphs from each family to give you a hand.

{% include /svg/kb/arial-vs-helvetica.svg %}{:width="90%"}

If it's Helvetica, its **a** has a tail. Arial's does not. Arial has angled terminals. Helvetica does not. For Arial, leg of the capital **R** straight. Helvetica's leg is all curvy.

Now you know!
