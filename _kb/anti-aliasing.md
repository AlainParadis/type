deck: "Anti-aliasing is the lighter pixels you see on edges of shapes when you zoom into a raster image."

Screens have an actual grid of pixels. That's really ideal when all the content on the screen is made of horizontal and vertical lines. What happens when a line is angled or curved? Those lines will look all jaggy as they're depicted with those square pixels.

Enter anti-aliasing. This is the feature which adds grey pixels along those edges to make them appear smooth.

As screens gain increasingly high resolution, these pixels get smaller and smaller. That just means that these pixels are so small the eye cannot differentiate them with the device at a normal reading distance.
