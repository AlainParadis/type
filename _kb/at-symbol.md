![The at symbol]({{site.url}}/svg/type-trivia/at-symbol.svg "The at symbol"){:width="120px"}

Before its use on the internet for e-mail addresses and use handles, the symbol was used to mean a rate. ie: *I purchased 3kg of beef @ $2/kg*. Before that, one of the first uses was as a symbol for the *arroba* in Spain and Portugal. It was a unit of weight of about 12kg.

It's not like the ampersand, where it says *and* but has the name *ampersand*. The @ symbol is pronounced *at* and is called *at*.
