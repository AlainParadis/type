You know what an em is, but have you really become familiar with all the fractions of ems and how they work?

So, an em is equal to the point size of type. If you have a word set at 32 points, then 1 em is equal to 32 points. The goal is to have a relative sizing system rather than an absolute one.

Let's say your basis size is 9 points. Your em size will be 9 points. You can set up a system with increasing by half with each step. You're just adding 50% to each number.
