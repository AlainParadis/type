You will design one of the following invitations:

Anniversary Gala
: This is an exclusive event at an Ottawa landmark. Its elegance and refinement will be unsurpassed. It will be attended by the who's-who of Canada's scientific community where these accomplished recipients will be honoured with the 2022 Whitford Prize.

Champagne Brunch
: The Springs Land Trust is a nature conservancy dedicated to wildlife habitats in and around Canada's National Capital. Dress is semi-formal. Guests will be donors to the conservancy, who are also avid users of the Capital's multi-use pathways for running, cycling, cross-country skiing, etc...

Cocktail Party
: This promised to be an intimate, private cocktail party in Ottawa's Westborough neighbourhood. If you're fortunate enough to be invited, you may rub elbows with famed authors and stars of Canada's publishing community.

Housewarming Party
: Jeff & Candace are a naturally likeable couple. They always enjoy the journey ahead of the destination. They are the hub of their social circle who just moved into a converted loft apartment with lots of exposed brick and ultra-high ceilings. The Smiths vinyl will be spinning. Cocktails will be flowing.

Wedding Invitation
: Josephine & James will be joined in marriage at this traditional christian ceremony with a novel twist. The bride and groom will light a unity candle to symbolize their bond. It will hosted by the groom's family at the Companions of the Cross church.
