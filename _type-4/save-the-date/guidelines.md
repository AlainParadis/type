This invitation will take the form of a card. It can be a simple single-sided or double-sided card. It can also have a fold.

The card will be delivered in an envelope, which you don't need to worry about.

This should be a minimal type-based design that uses hierarchy, limited colour for emphasis, and a refined typographic treatment.
