This invitation will take the form of a card. It can be a simple single-sided or double-sided card. It can also have a fold.

The card will be delivered in an envelope, which you don't need to worry about.

This should be a minimal type-based design that uses hierarchy, limited colour for emphasis, and a refined typographic treatment.

### Your Concept

Communicate your concept to the client. Submit a PDF file which includes your

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>type selection</li>
	<li>type treatment</li>
	<li>colour palette</li>
	<li>colour treatment</li>

The client needs to be able to make sense of these ingredients which make your design. They need to *see* the final product.
