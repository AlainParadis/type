Create a type system that has a baseline grid that's all in multiples so it can accomodate body copy and sizes of titles.

We'll build a single-page layout with two stories which will be side-by-site. Each type element will be aligned to the baseline grid.

Make a baseline grid that's divisible into each type element's leading. So:

1. 3 point increments in the baseline.
2. H1 with 24 point leading.
3. H2 with 18 point leading.
4. Byline with 12 point leading.
5. Body copy with 12 point leading.
6. etc...

These are all multiple of 3 points, so everything lines up on the baseline grid.
