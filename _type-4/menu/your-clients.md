These are the restaurants you have to choose from. Read carefully. Don't necessarily go with the first choice. Your comfort zone is not always the place that will yield the best designs.

Take the time to read the menu text content to see which is more appealing to you.

[Web Site](https://www.thebutchersdaughter.com/brooklyn/){:target="_blank"}—The Butcher’s Daughter is a plant-based restaurant, café, juice bar and *vegetable slaughterhouse* where fruits and vegetables are treated as a butcher would meat. The kitchen chops and carves fresh produce into healthy vegetarian dishes and presses them into pretty juices. The daily-changing menu is 100% vegetarian, and mostly vegan and gluten-free.

It's your all-day vegetarian, juice and wine bar. The white-washed, sun filled space is the perfect place to grab a morning Vittoria coffee and smashed avocado toast, a lunch-time spicy kale salad for that corporate meeting, or a wood-fired pizza over a glass of nebbiolo to wind down the day. The open-air market, features prepared foods and surf boards from Lone Wolf. Chef Nicolas Torrant has harnessed his vegetarian and raw food skills to exemplify local produce and technique to nourish mind, body and soul.

[Web Site](https://www.leadbellysbar.co.uk){:target="_blank"}—Leadbelly’s brings a contemporary bar and dining space to the Canada Water area of south-east London—perfect for relaxed eating and drinking. All their food is fresh, with a focus on well-sourced ingredients; from brunch to lunch, to bar bites and Sunday roasts.

Stepping out of the tube station, you will be greeted by the orange glow of the venue welcoming you. The venue is an interior designer’s dream. It's bright, but not garish, quirky but not tacky, and trendy, without looking like it’s had the same facelift as every other venue in east London. Yes, it has the painted brickwork, incandescent lightbulbs and metal work, but it feels totally cool and unique throughout.

Leadbelly’s is welcoming, laid back and ticks a lot of boxes. With it’s friendly staff and delicious, affordable and exciting food, this place is an absolute winner. Canada Water was clearly crying out for a place like this and I’m sure the local residents and workers couldn’t have asked for more.
