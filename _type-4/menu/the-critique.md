### About the Critique

This is about making the product better. It's very difficult to improve your design without input from others. A positive culture of critique supports better design solutions. It also enables collaboration. We need to keep the goals in mind. Remember our initial goals:

A well designed menu will increase profits significantly. … You need to keep in mind that diners at a restaurant want to relax. It doesn't matter if they're with family, on a first date, or meeting a client. No one wants to be bogged down in a menu that's unapproachable and confusing.

We want diners to be able to navigate the pages as smoothly as possible, finding their favourite dishes with ease. It's even better if they spend more money on add-ons and modifiers.

Bad critiquing
: *Yikes… that layout!*

Reformulation
: *How does this layout make it easier for the user to choose what to eat quickly and efficiently?*

### The Designer's Role

Talk about your menu. Act as if you were talking to your client, the restaurant owner.


<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>Open your menu, then share your screen</li>
	<li>Optionally, share a PDF so folks can look at it up close</li>
	<li>Explain the format</li>
	<li>Designer to present: materials, physical format</li>
	<li>Open a browser tabs at <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com" title="Adobe Fonts" target="_blank">Adobe Fonts</a> with your type choices</li>
	<li>Write down feedback</li>
</ul>

### Reviewers

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>Go around the table. Everyone should contribute at least two points.</li>
	<li>Critique readability with reduced vision</li>
	<li>The practicality & cost of the menu</li>
	<li>The type choice, colour, hierarchy</li>
	<li>Layout of menu sections & items</li>
	<li>Does it prompt diners to spend more? Could it do more?</li>
	<li>Use general statements rather than specific demands</li>
</ul>

### Things to avoid

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>Not agreeing on criteria beforehand</li>
	<li>Scheduling too long critique sessions</li>
	<li>Taking feedback personally</li>
	<li>Rushing to problem solve in the moment</li>
	<li>Talking only about the negatives</li>
</ul>
