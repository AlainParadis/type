You will design a restaurant menu with type, raster and vector graphics using provided content. The goal of this assignment is to capture the essence of the style of the establishment, then to express it in a type-based design. Your pages should ease diners' meal selection and make them feel welcome. This will increase sales for your client, the restaurant owner. See? Now everyone is well fed and happy!

This is your opportunity to use more than serif and sans-serif typefaces. A display face can be of use for section titles and to call attention to specials. Use display faces judiciously. Usually one well-chosen face will do the trick.

You'll can also create raster of vector graphics. Do not distract your diners! Too many graphics will overload the page and hinder decision-making.

## The Stages of the Project

### Choose Your Restaurant

Go to the [Restaurants page](your-clients.html) to read up and research which restaurant you want to work for. Make sure to go to their web sites. If you see their menu there, assume you're completely re-designing it.

### Research & Brainstorming

Investigate the restaurant you've chosen. They each have a back-story or they have location or style that will inform your design. You need to find in this research opportunities for design solutions.

Propose your concept to the client. You can include type selection, hierarchy and treatments; graphics and treatments; colours, and more. Your PDF can be more than one page.

Remember that you're pitching this to a non-designer. Organize the page layout so items are distinct from each other. You *could* make a page for colour, then a page for *type* and so on. Organize your pitch as you see fit. Just keep the client's point-of-view in mind.

### Development & Iteration

Work on an overall plan for your menu. Draw this out on paper. You should end up with a high-fidelity rendering of your menu on paper. This should be presentable to the client.

### Production

You'll build your design in InDesign, using Illustrator for vectors and Photoshop for raster imagery.

You'll need to ensure that the files are print-ready. This isn't a big deal. Limit and control your font usage. Use only high-resolution images, if you use raster images at all. Create vectors in Illustrator, then import the .ai file into InDesign. Keep your project folder organized.

### Submission

You'll need to make sure to keep your working folder organized for this project since you may have vector and raster files. [See the submission instructions](deliverables.html) for more details.
