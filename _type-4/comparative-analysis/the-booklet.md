There are no limits on the number of pages in your booklet. What's more important is to include all the required elements of the comparison.

Create the pages in normal reading order in InDesign. Just start your document on a right-hand page.

The dimensions of your booklet are for you to decide. Note that it is called a booklet. That suggests that its dimensions are small-ish.

As usual, pixels are not permitted. No photography allowed.

While we won't be printing this booklet for this assignment, we will build it as if we were. Put some thought into how you'd like to bind this in case you print it for your portfolio.
