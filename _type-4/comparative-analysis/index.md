This project is an analytical comparison of two type families which may appear to the layman to be very similar. The goal is to use your knowledge of the history and of the anatomy of type to recognize and identify similarities and differences in their characteristics. You will also compare the make-up of the families as a whole.

There is no limit to the number of slides in your presentation. What's more important is to include all the required elements of the comparison.
