### Historical Comparison

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>How does the development of the two families compare?</li>
	<li>Who are the designers?</li>
	<li>When were they released?</li>
	<li>Did they have a specific purpose when they were designed?</li>
</ul>

### Family Comparison

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>How many instances are there in each family?</li>
	<li>Compare glyph complements.</li>
	<li>Do the families include ornaments?</li>
	<li>Are there multiple writing systems? Cyrillic, Greek, etc…</li>
</ul>

### General Shape

Is the face round, open? Is the speed of the curve fast or slow? 

### X-Height

This is a key measurement that conveys the appearance of size for the family. This has an important effect at small and large sizes. What impact does this have on a block of text set at the same type size for the two families?

### Proportion

Four characters inform the proportions for the whole family.

The lower case n establishes the height of the lower case.

The lower case o establishes overshoot.

The cap H and O establish the width and the height for caps.

The n and the H provide patterns for serif structure across the family—full serifs, half serifs and wedge serifs.

The size of the ascenders and descenders is fixed across the family. It's what's *inside* this space that varies. The cap height, the x-height and the distance from the descender to the baseline all vary.

### Fit

The fit of the font is the careful sizing of the space on each side of the glyphs.

The side-baring of the glyph is the space to its right.

Evaluate the fit between

vvv
nnn
ooo
non
ono
vnv
nvn
ovo
vov

VVV
NNN
OOO
NON
ONO
VNV
NVN
OVO
VOV

Once you've looked at these, you can also examine the kerning pairs. They are spacing exceptions based on challenging pairs. Note cap A and cap V.

### Shape Variation

Three characters

R: Leg & Bowl

a: Serif, Bowl & Serif

g: Bowl, link, ear, loop

The shape of the eye in the lower case e.

The shape of the apex and the height of the crossbar on the cap A.

The angle of the spine on the capital S. The proportion of the top and bottom counters.

The bottom terminal of the capital J.

The tail of the Q.

The shape of the leg and the arm of the k or the K and their connections to the stem.

The shape and the overlap of the interior of the W.

The straight stem and serif of the capital G.

The upper terminal of the lower case r.

The entire shape of the ampersand.

Numbers, punctuations and diacritics also differ.



### Structural Comparison

What's below is a list to choose from. You won't compare all of these elements. Some won't be necessary for your two families. You need to look at the items then decide whether they're worth using in your analysis.

![Similar Forms]({{site.url}}/svg/analysis-similar.svg){:width="60%"}

![Analysis Terminals]({{site.url}}/svg/analysis-terminals.svg){:width="60%"}

How do the terminals compare? Are they bracketed serifs? Angled sans-serif terminals? Describe their general shape. How do they change with italics?

![Stroke Contrast]({{site.url}}/svg/analysis-stroke-contrast.svg){:width="90%"}

The relationship between the h m n u counters to those of the b d p q and o; the counter of the m is almost always a bit smaller than those of the h m n u, and those of the b d p q wider.

The relationship between counters and angles.

![Counters]({{site.url}}/svg/analysis-counters-v.svg){:width="90%"}

Comparison between the D O, C O and G O; between B P R and between the O o and zero

![Compare the o glyph across families]({{site.url}}/svg/analysis-o.svg){:width="60%"}

Is your typeface geometric? If so, how far is it from being perfectly round? They never really are. If it's not geometric, compare slant and stroke weight contrast.
