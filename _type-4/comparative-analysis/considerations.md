### Structural Comparison

What's below is a list to choose from. You won't compare all of these elements. Some won't be necessary for your two families. You need to look at the items then decide whether they're worth using in your analysis.

![Similar Forms]({{site.url}}/svg/analysis-similar.svg){:width="60%"}

![Analysis Terminals]({{site.url}}/svg/analysis-terminals.svg){:width="60%"}

How do the terminals compare? Are they bracketed serifs? Angled sans-serif terminals? Describe their general shape. How do they change with italics?

![Stroke Contrast]({{site.url}}/svg/analysis-stroke-contrast.svg){:width="90%"}

The relationship between the h m n u counters to those of the b d p q and o; the counter of the m is almost always a bit smaller than those of the h m n u, and those of the b d p q wider.

The relationship between counters and angles.

![Counters]({{site.url}}/svg/analysis-counters-v.svg){:width="90%"}

Comparison between the D O, C O and G O; between B P R and between the O o and zero

![Compare the o glyph across families]({{site.url}}/svg/analysis-o.svg){:width="60%"}

Is your typeface geometric? If so, how far is it from being perfectly round? They never really are. If it's not geometric, compare slant and stroke weight contrast.
