### Historical Comparison

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>How does the development of the two families compare?</li>
	<li>Who are the designers?</li>
	<li>When were they released?</li>
	<li>Did they have a specific purpose when they were designed?</li>
</ul>

### Family Comparison

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>How many instances are there in each family?</li>
	<li>Compare glyph complements.</li>
	<li>Do the families include ornaments?</li>
	<li>Are there multiple writing systems? Cyrillic, Greek, etcâ€¦</li>
</ul>


### Structural Comparison

What's below is a list to choose from. You won't compare all of these elements. Some won't be necessary for your two families. You need to look at the items then decide whether they're worth using in your analysis.

  <figure>
	{% include /svg/analysis-similar.svg %}
  <figcaption>
	Compare glyphs from both families that are built with similar forms.    
  </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>
	{% include /svg/analysis-terminals.svg %}
  <figcaption>
    Compare the properties of the terminals.
  </figcaption>
  </figure>

How do the terminals compare? Are they bracketed serifs? Angled sans-serif terminals? Describe their general shape. How do they change with italics?

  <figure>
	{% include /svg/analysis-stroke-contrast.svg %}    
  <figcaption>
	Compare stroke contrast differences or lack thereof.    
  </figcaption>
  </figure>

The relationship between the h m n u counters to those of the b d p q and o; the counter of the m is almost always a bit smaller than those of the h m n u, and those of the b d p q wider.

The relationship between counters and angles.

{% include /svg/analysis-counters-v.svg %}

Comparison between the D O, C O and G O; between B P R and between the O o and zero

  <figure>
	{% include /svg/analysis-o.svg %}    
  <figcaption>
    Compare the o glyph across families.
  </figcaption>
  </figure>

Is your typeface geometric? If so, how far is it from being perfectly round? They never really are. If it's not geometric, compare slant and stroke weight contrast.

  <figure>
	{% include /svg/analysis-curved-strokes.svg %}    
  <figcaption>
    Are the strokes of the glyphs straight, or do they have a curve as shown above?
  </figcaption>
  </figure>
