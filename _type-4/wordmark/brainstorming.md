# Wordmark Brainstorming

## What Are Wordmarks?

These need to be highly conceptual, type-only designs.

There are different types of logos. There are emblems, mascots, pictorial and other types. Wordmarks, or logotypes, are designed with type only. They depict the company name alone. They're appropriate for organizations and companies with short, distinct names. There are no pictorial elements, though some wordmarks have subtle, at times hidden, imagery within the letters. The combination of a novel company name and strong typography create a logotype which fosters strong brand recognition.

Since a wordmark is heavily reliant on type, it is important that you select or create typography that is appropriate to the tone of the brand—think elegant or traditional or fun or minimal.

Your final wordmark needs to be:

Memorable
: Much like a song, your wordmark needs a clever hook—that thing that makes other designers think *Darn, I wish I had thought of that!* 

Versatile
: It needs to be easy to depict across media. It should be just as distinct on a small screen, on apparel, stationery, etc… Avoid very thin stroke weights. They don't scale down well. The concept must not depend on the colours. That means that the mark works in a single colour.

Accessible
: The mark needs to be very legible. Elements cannot be obstructed by a contrived design trying too hard to integrate a visual. Contrast needs to be great enough so even those with vision challenges can discern your wordmark.

## Technical Requirements

- Type only
	- Choose a typeface, or draw it yourself.
	- If you draw it yourself, yes, you can customize an existing typeface. Just beware not to undo the care the typographer took when designing the original.
- Design for a full gamut of colours. Produce a version in
	- Black only. Reversed on black, too.
	- in RGB
	- in spot colours
	- in CMYK

## The Process

### Research

Read the brief posted about the company you've chosen. Research the concept behind the name of the company. 

### Concept Sketches

If you're using an existing typeface, you'll likely print the company name in that typeface as a base for your design. You can use tracing paper to reproduce it, then draw on top to develop your concept.
